    <h1><u>About</u></h1>


    <p> Our aim is to reduce the amount of computing experience a user requires when using our systems at JD Hotels. 
        <br>
        <br>
            We recognised the difficulty in learning the architecture of the company and how to navigate and use our system. 
        <br> 
            To eliminate the need for users with computing experience, to simplify the system and make more user friendly we have converted the system into a Chatbot.  
        <br>By converting our system into a Chatbot users will only be required to communicate with our system in their native language, as if they were communicating with a human. 
            
    </p>

    <h1><u>Rules</u></h1>
    <p> This is a working prototpye, and still under development. So could you please follow the below rules when using the chatbot.
        <li>Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> use any punctuation when making your enquiry!</li>
        <li>Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> use any ellison! E.g. Who's, Haven't, They're etc. </li>
        <li>Please <strong>SUBMIT</strong> your feedback after each query using YES if you are satisfied with your results NO if not. </li>
    </p>
