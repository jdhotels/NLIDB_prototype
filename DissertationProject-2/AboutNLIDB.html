    <h1>About project</h1>

    <p>
        This project was designed and create by Jonathan Leeming and Daniel Walker as part of a project for the final year of the Software Engineering course.
    </p>

    <p> The purpose of this system is to enable the user to input into a textbox their desired request for a reservation for a hotel and the system will process this request and produce a suitable output to the user. The data is completetely fictictious and
        is only used for the duration of our project.
        <h1><u>Rules</u></h1> As this is a working prototype and not the finished product we would be greatful if you follow these simple rules when making your enquiry:
        <li>Please <strong>do not</strong> use any punctuation when making your enquiry.</li>
        <li>Please do <strong>not</strong> use any ellison i.e Who's, haven't they're etc. </li>
    </p>
    <p>

        As you will see on the main enquiry page, we have implemented a feedback feature with buttons which lets us know whether or not you or satisfied with the results that have been given to you. We would appreciate if you use this feature after each individual
        enquiry you make. To do this, choose either <strong>'yes'</strong> or
        <strong>'no'</strong> and click the <strong>'submit'</strong> button as this will help us greatly.</li>
