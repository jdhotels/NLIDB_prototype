        <h1>About project</h1>

        <p>
            This project was designed and create by Jonathan Leeming and Daniel Walker as part of a project for the final year of the Software Engineering course.
        </p>

        <p> The purpose of this system is to enable the user to input into a textbox their desired request for a reservation for a hotel and the system will process this request and produce a suitable output to the user. The data is completetely fictictious
            and is only used for the duration of our project. As this is a prototype, we ask that you do not use any punctuation when making your reservation.
        </p>
        <p>As you will see on the main reservation page, we have implemented a feedback feature with buttons for yes, if you are satisfied with the results given or not. We would appreciate if you use this feature by choosing either 'yes' or 'no' and clicking
            the 'submit' button as this will help us greatly.</p>
